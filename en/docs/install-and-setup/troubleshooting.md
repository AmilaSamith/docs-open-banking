Product observability enables rapid debugging for you to process and eliminate product issues. In order to enable debugging 
in WSO2 Open Banking, you have to configure product observability in the two components seperately:

- WSO2 Identity Server
- WSO2 API Manager

!!!note
    By default, product observability is not enabled as it impacts on the product's performance.
