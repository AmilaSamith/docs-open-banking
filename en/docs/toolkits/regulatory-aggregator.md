A regulatory body is an entity that enforces regulations for open banking and open finance regulations in a country or 
a region. ACCC in Australia and FCA in the UK are examples of such entities. Some of these are well-established entities 
even before open banking and they take care of different aspects of monetary policy enforcement.

Apart from enforcing policies, some entities implement open banking in their country and provide services to financial 
institutions and third-party apps. In addition, some regulatory bodies are placing themselves as the central gateway for 
open banking APIs. This, in turn, allows third-party apps to connect with this gateway of regulatory aggregators instead 
of registering with each financial institution individually. This type of aggregator is known as a Regulatory Aggregator.

In simple terms, a regulatory aggregator is an authoritative entity in a region that acts as the sole open banking 
interface and the gateway for all open banking services provided by financial institutions in that particular area.

### Regulatory Aggregator Ecosystem

The Regulatory Aggregator is the gateway for all the API calls instead of just being the validator.  In this ecosystem, 
all third-party applications are only registered with the regulatory aggregator, and all the API calls, including token 
and authorization calls, are done via the regulatory aggregator.  They are connected to all financial institutions via 
a secure channel and the financial institutes trust the regulatory aggregator. 

### WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator and Regulatory Aggregator

WSO2 Open Banking Accelerators are implemented to cater to a variety of open banking regulatory requirements in 
financial institutions around the globe. These accelerators were initially used to build a solution layer that would be 
placed in front of the bankâ€™s existing API layer to make them compliant with regulations. The Regulatory Aggregator 
component is expected to handle consent management, third-party onboarding,  federated user authentication, and regulatory 
reporting, which are already included in the WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator. Therefore, a small toolkit is developed on 
top of the accelerators to fulfil the Regulatory Aggregator requirements seamlessly.
