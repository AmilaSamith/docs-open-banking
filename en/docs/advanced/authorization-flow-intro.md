During the consent authorization process, the banks redirect customers to provide consent for API consumers to access 
their banking information. The process is as follows:

1. API consumer requests to access banking information of a customer.
2. Bank validates the API consumerâ€™s request.
3. Bank displays customer the information that the API consumer wishes to access.
4. Bank authenticates the customer. 
5. Customer can view the information before consenting to it

##Authorization flow in WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator

WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator consists of the following components:

###Authorization endpoint
When the API consumer sends an authorization request before accessing banking information, it contains authorization 
parameters in a request object. This request object is a self-contained JWT, which helps banks to validate the API consumer.

The method of sending the authorization request can vary as follows:

- **Send the authorization details in the authorization URL**

API consumers share the request object containing the authorization details to the authorization server and obtain the 
authorization URL.

- **Send the authorization details as a reference in the authorization URL**

API consumers push authorization details directly to the authorization server and obtain a reference. This method is also 
known as **Pushed Authorization**. The reference is notated by the claim; `request_uri`. Thereby, it prevents:

- Intruders from intercepting the authorisation information sent in the request_object
- Authorisation request calls becoming large with the authorisation details signed in the JWT
and protects the confidentiality and integrity of the authorization details when passing through a third-party application.

###Authorization web application 
API consumers obtain an authorization URL that redirects the customer to a web interface. In this web application, the customer:

- Logs in using the login credentials. 
- Views information that the third-party provider requested to access.
- Selects the accounts that the third-party provider can access.
- Provides consent to the third-party provider to access the information.

###Identifier-first authenticator
Banks use Identifier-first authentication to authenticate the user with a second-factor authenticator instead of password. 
The user who logs into the authorization web application, can provide the username, and authenticate using a second-factor 
authentication mechanism such as SMS-OTP/TOTP.
