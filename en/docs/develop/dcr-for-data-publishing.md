You can enable data publishing for Dynamic Client Registration by following the steps given below:

1. To publish the data during dynamic client registration application, extend the following class:
```java
com.wso2.openbanking.accelerator.identity.listener.application.ApplicationUpdaterImpl
```

To extend the validation capabilities according to your requirements, override the relevant methods in this class. Given 
below is a brief description of each class:

###publishData method
This method publishes the data when creating a dynamic client registration application. For example,
```java
public void publishData(Map < String, Object > spMetaData, OAuthConsumerAppDTO oAuthConsumerAppDTO)
throws OpenBankingException {
```
###doPostDeleteApplication method
This method publishes the data when deleting the dynamic client registration application. For example,
```java
public void doPostDeleteApplication(ServiceProvider serviceProvider, String tenantDomain, String userName)
throws OpenBankingException {
```

##Configurations
1. Add the classes that you extended to enable data publishing for the Dynamic Client Registration flow in <IS_HOME>/ repository/ conf/ 
deployment.toml as follows:
```toml
[open_banking.dcr]
applicationupdater = "com.wso2.finance.openbanking.accelerator.identity.dcr.validation.<extended_class_name>"
```

2. Once you  the data elements that you need for data publishing, define the stream and their attributes with the priority 
in <IS_HOME>/ repository/ conf/ deployment.toml using the following format:
```toml
[[open_banking.data_publishing.thrift.stream]]
name="streamNamex"
[[open_banking.data_publishing.thrift.stream.attributes]]
name="attributeset1x"
priority=3
[[open_banking.data_publishing.thrift.stream.attributes]]
name="attributeset2x"
priority=1
```
For example,
```toml
[[open_banking.data_publishing.thrift.stream.attributes]]
name="timestamp"
priority=6
required=true
type="long"
```
    - `required` is treated as `false` if not explicitly mentioned.
    - `type` is treated as `string` if not explicitly mentioned.
