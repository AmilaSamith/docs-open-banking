# Open Banking 


Open banking is a mechanism that enables financial institutions to securely, and with the consumerâ€™s 
consent, expose data and services (e.g., account information, payment initiation) via standardized APIs to authorised 
third parties. 
These third parties, including app developers and other financial institutions, are in turn able to build new financial 
services offerings for consumers using the data and services made available through open banking APIs. 
Open banking gives consumers more control over their data, offers greater financial transparency, a more equal chance of
success for all financial service providers, and importantly, more innovative services for customers that matches their 
current requirements.
