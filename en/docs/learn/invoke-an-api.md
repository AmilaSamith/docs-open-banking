!!!note
    This document provides requests and responses for the sample Account Information Service API available in WSO2 Open 
    Banking Accelerator. In a real-life open banking environment, the API consumer applications can retrieve details of 
    accounts for which the bank customer has granted them consent.

- An API consumer can now invoke the `GET/ accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>` endpoint. A sample request looks as follows:
```
curl -X GET \
https://localhost:8243/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts/1' \
-H 'x-fapi-financial-id: open-bank' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'charset: UTF-8' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8'
--cert <PUBLIC_KEY_FILE_PATH> --key <PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PATH> \
```
- The request retrieves the account information for the Account ID you mentioned in the request.

    !!! note
        This is a sample response generated by the mock back end available in WSO2 Open Banking.
